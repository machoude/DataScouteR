# Welcome to DataScouteR

**DataScouteR** is an R package for football scouting and player evaluation, providing **league-adjusted, position-specific ratings** derived from publicly available data and scaled for **intuitive interpretation**.

The package is designed to offer a clean, ready-to-use interface for analysts, researchers, and practitioners who want access to **processed scouting outputs**, without needing to run complex models themselves.

Currently supports **goalkeepers**, **midfielders** and **forwards**.

---

## Installation

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("machoude/DataScouteR", subdir = "DataScouteR")
```
---

## Players

```r
library(DataScouteR)
gk <- get_gk()
head(gk)

mf <- get_mf()
head(mf)

fw <- get_fw()
head(fw)
```

---

## Data Source

All underlying match and event-level statistics are sourced from:

- **FBref** 

FBref provides high-quality, publicly accessible football statistics.  
`DataScouteR` uses these data as inputs but **does not redistribute raw FBref datasets**.

---

## Methodology

The workflow behind the package follows these principles:

- Player performance metrics are modeled using **z-scores and logistic mapping**
- **Player-level effects** are filtered to reduce noise from small samples
- **League-level effects** are included to implicitly account for competition strength
- Final latent ability estimates are transformed to a **1–20 scale** using a smooth, monotonic mapping

This scaling is **not intended to replicate Football Manager internally**, but rather to:

- Provide a familiar reference frame
- Improve interpretability for practitioners

---

## Why a 1–20 Scale?


The 1–20 scale:

- Preserves **relative differences** between players
- Compresses extreme values smoothly
- Allows quick qualitative interpretation (e.g. *elite*, *above average*, *poor*)


This makes the results more accessible for:

- Scouting discussions
- Player profiling
- Comparative analysis across leagues

## Interpreting the Metrics

The ratings in DataScouteR are scaled from 1 to 20 FM-style for easier comparison. 
A player’s score shows how well they performed this season, relative to other players in the dataset.

For example, if a goalkeeper has a 16 in ShotStopping while Alisson has 8, it does not mean the player is generally better than Alisson. 
It only indicates that, in the current season, this player performed better in shot-stopping relative to the other goalkeepers in the dataset.

Also get_fw() and get_md() use similar metrics, the ratings are position-specific.
A Scoring rating of 15 for a midfielder does not carry the same meaning as a 15 for a forward, since all scores are calculated relative to players in the same position group.


This scale is designed for seasonal comparison, not historical ranking. High numbers mean above-average performance this year, 
while lower numbers indicate below-average performance for the same season.
