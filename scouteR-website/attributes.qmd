## Goalkeepers

- ShotStopping : Ability to prevent goals from shots on target through reflexes, positioning, and reach. This is the core goalkeeper skill.

- Passing : Quality and reliability of short and medium distribution with the feet. Reflects composure under pressure and ability to participate in buildup without setting traps for teammates.

- CrossStopping : Effectiveness in dealing with crosses and high balls into the box. Includes catching, punching, timing off the line, and decision-making under traffic.

- Sweeper : Ability to read play, leave the box, and intercept through balls or clear danger behind a high defensive line.

## Defenders

- Creativity : Ability to create chances from deep areas through vision, unexpected passes, or carrying the ball forward. For defenders, this means breaking lines, not pretending to be a number 10.

- ShortPassing : Accuracy and consistency of short and medium passes used to maintain possession and build play from the back.

- LongPassing : 

- Assisting : Direct contribution to goals via assists or assist-like actions. Rare for defenders, but valuable for those who overlap, take set pieces, or step into midfield.

- AttPassing : Quality of forward and line-breaking passes that advance the attack into dangerous zones. This separates “safe distributor” from “actually progressive defender.”

- AdvancedTouches : Frequency and effectiveness of touches in advanced areas. For defenders, this reflects overlaps, underlaps, and set-piece involvement, not reckless wandering.

- Dribbling : Ability to beat pressure with the ball, escape pressing, and carry possession forward. Crucial for modern fullbacks who are asked to progress play under pressure.

- Progression : Combined ability to move the ball forward through carries and progressive passes. This is about territory gained, not just possession retained.

- ShootAcc : Accuracy of shots taken. Low-volume for defenders, but important for those who arrive late in the box or threaten from distance and set pieces.

- Scoring : Effectiveness in converting chances into goals, especially from headers, rebounds, or set plays. 

- Blocking : Ability to block shots and passes through positioning, anticipation, and body control. This is defensive awareness made visible.

- Tackling : Timing and success of defensive challenges to regain possession without fouling. Good tackling is boring, efficient, and deeply appreciated by coaches.

## Midfielders

- Creativity :Ability to generate chances through vision, imagination, and decision-making in tight spaces. For midfielders, this is about seeing options before they exist and choosing the least obvious one.

- ShortPassing : Accuracy and reliability of short and medium passes used to circulate possession and control tempo. This is the baseline skill. Without it, everything else is noise.

- LongPassing :

- Assisting : Direct contribution to goals through assists and final balls. Reflects timing, awareness, and execution in the final third, not just spamming key passes.

- AttPassing : Quality of forward, line-breaking passes that move the ball into dangerous areas. This is how midfielders turn possession into threat instead of recycling it endlessly.

- AdvancedTouches : Frequency and effectiveness of touches in advanced areas, including the final third and penalty area. Indicates attacking involvement and positional intelligence, not goal-hanging.

- Dribbling : Ability to beat opponents under pressure, carry the ball through midfield, and create numerical advantages. Essential for escaping presses and breaking defensive shape.

- Progression : Overall ability to advance play via progressive passes and carries. For midfielders, this is territorial responsibility. If this is low, the team goes sideways.

- ShootAcc : Accuracy of shots taken from open play, often from range or late runs into the box. Midfielders don’t shoot often, so when they do, it should mean something.

- Scoring : Efficiency in converting chances into goals, including long shots, rebounds, and box arrivals. Reflects timing, composure, and shot selection, not volume.

- Blocking : Ability to block shots and passing lanes through positioning and anticipation. For midfielders, this is defensive intelligence, not last-ditch heroics.

- Tackling : Effectiveness and timing of challenges to regain possession. Good midfield tackling disrupts rhythm and kills transitions before they become problems.

## Forwards

- Creativity : Ability to create chances for others through vision, movement, and improvisation in attacking areas. For forwards, this means making something happen when structure collapses.

- ShortPassing : Quality and reliability of short passes and layoffs in tight spaces. Reflects link-up play, combination ability, and not killing attacks with sloppy touches.

- LongPassing :

- Assisting : Direct contribution to goals via assists or final balls. Indicates awareness of teammates, timing, and willingness to pass when shooting is the wrong choice.

- AttPassing : Quality of progressive and defense-splitting passes in the final third. Important for forwards who drop deep or operate between the lines.

- AdvancedTouches : Frequency and effectiveness of touches in the final third and penalty area. Measures attacking involvement, off-ball movement, and ability to arrive in dangerous zones.

- Dribbling : Ability to beat defenders one-on-one, create separation, and destabilize defensive shape. Essential for wide forwards and isolation-heavy roles.

- Progression : Ability to move play forward through carries and passes under pressure. For forwards, this reflects ball-carrying threat rather than buildup responsibility.

- ShootAcc : Accuracy of shots on target. Measures placement and shot selection, not volume. A forward who shoots often but inaccurately is just optimistic.

- Scoring : Efficiency in converting chances into goals. This is finishing quality, composure, and timing. The attribute people pretend not to care about but absolutely do.
